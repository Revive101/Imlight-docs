# Commands
A number of commands are available for game masters.

Security tiers:
* `0` - Normal Player
* `1` - Quality Assurance
* `2` - Hall Monitors
* `3` - Developers (_only available in debug build_)
* `4` - Game Master

If Imlight was built in _release_ mode, any command with a developer security level required will instead be forwarded to Game Master tier.
